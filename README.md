## Overview
A countries listing microsite with the ability to filter country be your search term or filters. The app also remembers your setting for light or darkmode using the localStorage API.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## My process

I initally developed the app within the bounds of the designs, but further developed the layout a to make the screens feel a little more integrated and aligned to make for a more cohesive experience.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript syntax
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used TypeScript to further develop my skills and came across some tricky situations to account for certain initial states for properties.

It was the first time working with the countries REST API and it seems to have some missing information to make the development of the app, which required an additional local data source to be curated to enable the app to work.

### Continued development

I will definitely be using more TypeScript in future to enhance my skillset.
